# HR Management System - Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Employee Add Confirmation Issue
**Problem**: When adding an employee by admin, no confirmation message was showing and user needed to go to employee section to verify.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed `AddEmployee.jsx` component to properly handle API responses
- Added better response validation with `response.success !== false`
- Enhanced success message to show employee ID when created
- Improved error handling for both success and failure scenarios

**Files Modified**:
- `src/AddEmployee.jsx`

### 2. Employee Delete Not Refreshing List
**Problem**: After confirming employee deletion, the list didn't refresh automatically and page refresh was required.

**Solution**:
- Modified `AllEmployee.jsx` to update local state immediately after successful deletion
- Used `setEmployees(prevEmployees => prevEmployees.filter(emp => emp.id !== empId))` to remove deleted employee from state
- Added success message confirmation after deletion
- Enhanced error handling for deletion failures

**Files Modified**:
- `src/AllEmployee.jsx`

### 3. Leave Request "Failed to Fetch" Error
**Problem**: Leave request functionality showing "Failed to fetch request" error.

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive `LeaveController.cs` with all necessary endpoints:
  - GET `/api/leave/requests` - Get all leave requests
  - GET `/api/leave/requests/user/{userId}` - Get user-specific leave requests  
  - POST `/api/leave/requests` - Create new leave request
  - PUT `/api/leave/requests/{id}/status` - Update leave request status
  - DELETE `/api/leave/requests/{id}` - Delete leave request
  - GET `/api/leave/summary/{employeeId}` - Get leave summary
  - GET `/api/leave/balance/{employeeId}` - Get leave balance
  - GET `/api/leave/types` - Get available leave types

- Updated `LeaveRequest.cs` model with proper validation attributes and computed properties
- Added DTOs for request/response handling
- Enhanced error handling with proper HTTP status codes

**Files Created**:
- `Controllers/LeaveController.cs`

**Files Modified**:
- `Models/LeaveRequest.cs`

### 4. Frontend Configuration Fixes
**Problem**: Proxy configuration and port mismatches.

**Solution**:
- Updated `vite.config.js` to use correct port (5173)
- Verified CORS configuration in backend for React dev server ports
- Ensured API proxy routes are correctly configured

**Files Modified**:
- `my-react-app/vite.config.js`

2. **Start Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd my-react-app
   npm run dev
   ```
   Frontend will run on: http://localhost:5173

3. **Use Both Together**:
   ```powershell
   .\start-both.ps1
   ```

## Testing

Run the leave API tests:
```powershell

```

## Login Credentials

**Admin Access**:
- Email: `admin@company.com`
- Password: `admin123`
